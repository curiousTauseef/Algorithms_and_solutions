'''
A non-empty array A consisting of N numbers is given. The array is sorted in non-decreasing order. The absolute distinct count of this array is the number of distinct absolute values among the elements of the array.

For example, consider array A such that:

  A[0] = -5
  A[1] = -3
  A[2] = -1
  A[3] =  0
  A[4] =  3
  A[5] =  6
The absolute distinct count of this array is 5, because there are 5 distinct absolute values among the elements of this array, namely 0, 1, 3, 5 and 6.

Write a function:

def solution(A)

that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N numbers, returns absolute distinct count of array A.

For example, given array A such that:

  A[0] = -5
  A[1] = -3
  A[2] = -1
  A[3] =  0
  A[4] =  3
  A[5] =  6
the function should return 5, as explained above.

Assume that:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647];
array A is sorted in non-decreasing order.
Complexity:

expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
expected worst-case space complexity is O(N) (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

# Keep in mind NON-DECREASING means elements in A might be repeated

# Caterpilar method:

    # Keep track of absolute value (1 loop only)
    Ab = [abs(a) for a in A]

    low = 0

    # keep a count
    count = 0

    while up >= low:

            count += 1
            # Decrease index until a different element is found
            up -= 1
            while Ab[up] == Ab[up+1] and up >= low:
                up -= 1


        elif Ab[up] < Ab[low]:
            count += 1
            # Increase index until a different element is found

                up -= 1

            low += 1
            while Ab[low] == Ab[low-1] and up >= low:
                low += 1
